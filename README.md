# Hi, I'm Erick Vera

Software Architect with a strong focus on frontend engineering, specialized in building well-structured, scalable web applications using TypeScript.

## About Me

I work as a Software Architect in production environments, designing and maintaining systems with an emphasis on clarity, maintainability, and long-term evolution.

My main strength is frontend architecture: structuring applications, defining boundaries, and building clean, predictable user interfaces.  
At the same time, I work as a full stack developer, designing and consuming APIs, handling authentication flows, and integrating backend services when needed.

I value simple solutions, clear responsibilities, and code that is easy to reason about.
